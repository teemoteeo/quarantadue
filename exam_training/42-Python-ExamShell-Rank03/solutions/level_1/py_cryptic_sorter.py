def cryptic_sorter(strings: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Write a function that sorts a list of strings according to multiple criteria:
    1. Primary sort: By string length (shortest first)
    2. Secondary sort: ASCII order, except letters are compared case-insensitively
   (for strings of same length)
    3. Tertiary sort: By number of vowels (ascending, for same length and lexically equal)
    4. Equal strings will appear in the same order as in the input list.
